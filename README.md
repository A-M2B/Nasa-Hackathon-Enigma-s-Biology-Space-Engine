We have developed a web application that is based on AI, databases, knowledge graphs, RAG and other tools and that provides precise and structured results (introduction, results and summary) on the question asked to a chatbot which responds according to the target audience and also we have a search bar that allows finding and filtering among the searched articles the links and important data. Our solution addresses the challenge by making relevant data accessible to anyone in a short time. Our solution is important because it facilitates access to accurate and useful data without wasting time and also responds by taking into account similar information to provide the most relevant results and answers.
